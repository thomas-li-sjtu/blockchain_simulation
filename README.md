# BlockChain Simulation
Simulate a certain number of nodes to generate the state of the blockchain.  
The setting parameters include: number of nodes, workload.

a) Measure the basic performance of blockchain, including growth rate and throughput

b) Set a certain number of malicious nodes to implement attacks, measuring the length of success of bifurcation attacks under different malicious node ratios (10% - 40%)
